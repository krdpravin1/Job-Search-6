# Job Snoop (Vercel single-repo)

Minimal Vite + React frontend with a serverless API (in /api) for lightweight scraping.
Deploy on Vercel by connecting this repository and clicking Deploy.

Steps:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` (local dev)
3. Push to GitHub and connect the repo in Vercel â€” deploy.

Note: The serverless API scrapes RSS and simple pages; some large sites (LinkedIn, Naukri) may block scraping or require headless browsers.
